So... you want to play some 40k without suffering 6 hours of trains exploding with sweaty tourists...
Fear not, Tabletop simulator (and a blossoming community of players) is here to save you.

## What is Tabletop Simulator?

Well... the name speaks for itself. Tabletop simulator (TTS) is a game built to simulate a tabletop. This offers a blank canvas for modders, companies and communities. The game is programmed specifically to act as a scaffold for any game which uses a physical medium to be played (cards, models, figures, boards... practically all games that are not videogames). Thus it lends itself very well to playing Warhammer 40k.

###### Technical requirements
- Consider investing in a decent speaker and mic setup, nobody enjoys hearing your gf spreading the good word of Lorgar in the background. 
###### System requirements
- OS: Windows 7 SP1+/ macOS 10.12+
- Processor: SSE2 instruction set support.
- Memory: 4 GB RAM
- Graphics: Graphics card with DX10 (shader model 4.0) capabilities.
- DirectX: Version 10
- Network: Broadband Internet connection
- Storage: 3 GB available space
- VR Support: SteamVR

**Be mindful that even though TTS itself can be run on a potato, big 40k games can push up the requirements. Ask the ork player :)**

## Installation
Tabletop Simulator is available on steam, and it is discounted often and heavily. I hope i don't need to explain how to buy games on steam, but open an issue if that is giving you problems.

## Mods
Warhammer is a game with a very complicated and dynamic ruleset. This can make the game challenging to set up and play, but it also brings a big advantage. A LOT of nerds play it, and it just so happens that nerds are often good at programming, organising and automatising things. A community of 40k player has created two very important tools to play warhammer:
- **The [Battleforged mod](https://github.com/TTSWarhammer40k/Battleforged-Workshop-Mod-Compilation):** A tool that contains and a vast collection of maps and models. Installation intructions are in their GitHub, since the table and the models need to be present on your machine.
- **The [competitive 40k map](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2716384879):** A TTS table made specifically for 40k
- **The [Yellowscribe Mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2920625970) and its [companion website](https://yellowscribe.xyz/):** Yellowscribe allows you to convert a battlescribe ```.rosz``` file into datasheets which can be assigned to ```battleforged```models and the be used to generate an army automatically. Keeping the datasheets and the models separated allows you to keep up with the latest rules without constantly updating model descriptions.

Subscribe to all of them (you will find a lot of stuff in the TTS mods, like a trophy for your opponent's epic snake eyes charge)

## Creating and importing lists
Army lists are created with [Battlescribe](https://battlescribe.net/?tab=news). Export your list as a ```.rosz``` file. We will convert this file into datasheets which can be assigned to models in a bit. In Tabletop simulator, open your army collection in ```Save & Load --> Battleforged mod pack --> Warhammer 40,000 --> Army collections --> <your army>``` and then perform a selection of models. What i mean by that is; take each unique model you will need for your army and move them on the edge of the table (need 147 ork boyz? take 1!) and try to keep them relatively close to each other. Remember that units with heterogenous weapons and champions need different models (looking at you termies). Select this subset of models with your mouse, right-click them and save them as an object. Fight your instinct to name them ```2k_test_LOL``` or ```asdasdasd```, i would argue that taking 3 seconds out of your very busy life to name them properly will save you a lot of headaches if you ever need them again. Once you get more familiar with how yellowscribe works you can prepare your favorite units or armies in advance and have them saved as objects in your arsenal of models. Now, go back to the main menu and open yellowscribe v2. Now also open chrome and go to the [Yellowscribe website](https://yellowscribe.xyz/). There you will upload your ```.rosz``` file. Now you can check all your datasheets and rename them as you please (f.ex. "'Zerker rhino" and "Eightbound rhino"). Once you are satisfied, go to the bottom of the website and hit submit. This will generate a code, which you will paste in the Yellowscribe table in TTS you had open in the background and submit again. This will generate all the datasheets of your army on the right side of the table. And on the left side you will generate your models by going to objects on top of the screen, hit saved objects and click the properly named subset of models we prepared. Then click on the left side of the table ONCE and then hit esc. Well done! Now we have datasheets and models. To link them, click on a datasheet (which will light up pink) and select the appropriate model (this will turn the datasheet green). Note that multiple datasheets can be tied to the same model. Once all datasheets are green, hit the magical ```create army``` button. And there you go, Yellowscribe has generated your army with the appropriate models and the latest datasheets. Now select all the models and save them as an object by right clicking them. Congratulations! Your army is ready for battle! I know, not as pretty as your IRL army, but well' make do.
